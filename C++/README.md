## General Info
This repository contains the code for a `Matrix` class in C++, allowing for the creation of, manipulation of, and operation on matrices. All code was created by me, Isaac Joffe, for my CMPUT 275 course in March of 2022.

## Technologies
The code contained is written in C++ and designed to be compiled using C++ 11 (as demonstrated in the makefile). The provided makefile utilizes the G++ compiler to create object files and binary executables to run and test all of the source code in this repository. I created all the code using my personal virtual machine, which runs the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux operating system, through the Sublime Text text editor and the Linux terminal window.

## Instructions
Currently, the program can only be used through a driver file. A small example file uis provided.

The provided makefile allows for the execution of the test file provided. To run the test, type `make` in the Linux terminal while in the proper directory and run the output file.

## Example Usage
```
make
./test
```
